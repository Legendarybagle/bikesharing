## Overview
The point of this analysis was to use Tableau and the citibikes data to show: the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results

In this story point is a dashboard containing 2 graphs, they both show the length of time the bikes were checked out for, the top one shows for all users and the bottom one is split by gender. The graphs show that most of the trips only lasted 5-10 minutes and then slowly less and less until the line flattens to only a few rides that lasted longer than 40 minutes. It seems most trips taken by useres reguardless of gender were fairly short.

the next story point shows The number of bike trips for all riders and broken up by gender for each hour of the week. While there were way more male users, the spread of the ride times was about the same for all genders. 6-9AM and 5-6PM were the most common times each day, with Monday, Tuesday and Thursday being the most popular days, every time showed a small spike on the weekend as well but nothing as extreme as days previously mentioned.

The finaly story point shows the number fo bike trips for each day broken up by user and gender. Both male and femal show the same patterns for both subsriber and non-subscribers, the data shows that Thursday and Friday had the most riders.
